  <h3>Steps:</h3>
  <p> 1. First, make the donuts. In a stand mixer fitted with the paddle 
      attachment, beat the granulated sugar and butter on low speed until combined. 
      Gradually increase the speed to medium and beat for 30 seconds. <br>
      2. Next, dry the out the pumpkin puree. Place the pumpkin puree on a thick 
      paper towel and blot out the excess moisture. <br>
      3. Add the dried pumpkin puree, buttermilk, flour, baking powder, salt, and 
      spices and mix on low speed until a thick dough forms and no streaks of flour
      remain. <br>
      4. Remove the dough from the mixer, flatten into an oval disc, and wrap 
      tightly in plastic wrap. Place in the fridge rest for 1 hour. <br>
      5. Turn the chilled dough onto a well-floured surface. Use a rolling pin to roll
      the dough out to a ½ inch thickness. Use a 3 ½ inch donut cutter (or a 3 ½-inch 
      circle shaped cutter and a smaller 1-inch cutter to stamp out the middle hole) 
      to cut out the donuts, saving the donut holes. Use a pastry brush to gently brush 
      off any excess flour on each donut. Gather the scraps together into a ball and gently 
      knead them together. Roll out and cut the dough again! <br>
      6. Heat 4 inches of oil in a large pot over medium-low heat to 325°F. Place a cooling 
      rack on top of a baking sheet and set aside. <br>
      7. While the oil heats, make the glaze. In a medium bowl, combine the powdered sugar, 
      milk, maple syrup and vanilla extract and whisk to combine. Set aside. <br>
      8. Fry 2 to 3 donuts at a time (being careful to not overcrowd the pot) for 2 minutes. 
      At this point you should be able to see the edges begin to look crisp. Flip the donut 
      and continue cooking until the donuts have expanded and have craggy edges all over, 
      about 1 more minute. Use a slotted metal spatula to transfer them to the prepared cooling 
      rack and repeat with the remaining donuts and donut holes (the donut holes will fry in 
      about half the time).<br>
      9. Once they’re cool enough to the touch (but still warm), dip the top half of each fried 
      donut into the glaze, then place back on the cooling rack (glazed side up) until the glaze 
      has set, about 10 minutes. Serve within 4 hours of frying.

  <h3>Steps:</h3>
  <p> 1. Place the butter in a small saucepan and set over medium low heat. Low heat 
      is key to an even, golden browning! Use a silicone spatula to stir and scrape the 
      butter from the bottom and sides of the pan every 10 to 15 seconds. At first, the 
      butter will melt and foam, then over time the foam bubbles will get smaller and the 
      butter will begin to emit a warm, nutty aroma. Continue to cook the butter, occasionally 
      stirring and scraping with your spatula, until the butter begins to take on color and you 
      see small floating brown bits, about 5 to 7 minutes (these are the milk solids in your 
      butter separating and toasting). Once the butter is golden brown, remove it from the heat 
      and allow it to cool in the saucepan for a few minutes. <br>
      2. In a large mixing bowl, combine the brown butter, brown sugar, and granulated sugar. 
      Use a silicone spatula to mix together. Add the egg, extra egg yolk, and vanilla and mix 
      well. <br>
      3. Add in the flour, baking soda, salt and fold until no streaks of flour remain, being 
      careful not to overmix your batter. The dough should be soft but not sticky, so when you 
      touch it with your finger, it gives just a little.  <br>
      4. Fold in the chocolate chips until evenly distributed. Do not over mix. Cover the bowl 
      and place it in the fridge to chill for at least 1 hour (and up to overnight). <br>
      5. Preheat the oven to 350°F. Line two baking sheets with parchment paper. Remove the dough 
      from the fridge and allow it to soften at room temperature until it’s scoopable (about 20 
      minutes). Use a 1 ½ ounce cookie scoop to portion out equal amounts of dough. Place on the 
      prepared baking sheets, spacing the dough 2 inches apart. <br>
      6. Bake until the cookies have puffed up and are light golden brown around the edges but 
      still somewhat soft in the middle, 12 to 13 minutes. Remove the baking sheet from the oven, 
      sprinkle with flaky sea salt (if using), and allow the cookies to cool slightly on the baking 
      sheet before serving. <br>

  <h3>Steps:</h3>
  <p> 1. Preheat the oven to 350°F and line a 9 x 9-inch baking pan with parchment 
      paper on all sides. Set aside. <br>
      2. First make the cookie layer. In a large mixing bowl combine the melted butter, 
      brown sugar and granulated sugar. Use a silicone spatula to stir to combine. Add 
      the egg, egg yolk and vanilla extract and mix well. <br>
      3. Add the flour, baking soda and salt to the mixing bowl and fold together until 
      just mixed and no streaks of flour remain. Add the chocolate chips and fold to 
      combine. <br>
      4. Scrape the batter into the prepared pan and pat into an even layer. Place the 
      Oreo cookies all over the top of the cookie dough, gently pressing them into the 
      dough. Set aside. <br>
      5. Prepare the brownie mix according to directions and pour over the Oreo cookies, 
      using a silicone spatula to spread into an even layer. <br>
      6. Bake for 45 to 55 minutes (it can depend on your brownie mix!) or until a knife 
      inserted into the middle comes out mostly clean. Cool completely before slicing and 
      serving! <br>
