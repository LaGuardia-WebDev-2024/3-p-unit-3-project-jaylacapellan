  <h3>Steps:</h3>
  <p> 1. First, make the donuts. In a stand mixer fitted with the paddle attachment, beat the granulated sugar and butter on low speed until combined. Gradually increase the speed to medium and beat for 30 seconds.
Add the pumpkin puree, buttermilk, flour, baking powder, salt, and spices and mix on low speed until a thick dough forms and no streaks of flour remain.
Remove the dough from the mixer, flatten into an oval disc, and wrap tightly in plastic wrap. Place in the fridge rest for 1 hour.
Turn the chilled dough onto a well-floured surface. Use a rolling pin to roll the dough out to a ½ inch thickness. Use a 3 ½ inch donut cutter (or a 3 ½-inch circle shaped cutter and a smaller 1-inch cutter to stamp out the middle hole) to cut out the donuts, saving the donut holes. Use a pastry brush to gently brush off any excess flour on each donut. Gather the scraps together into a ball and gently knead them together. Roll out and cut the dough again!
Heat 4 inches of oil in a large pot over medium-low heat to 325°F. Place a cooling rack on top of a baking sheet and set aside.
While the oil heats, make the glaze. In a medium bowl, combine the powdered sugar, milk, maple syrup and vanilla extract and whisk to combine. Set aside.

Fry 2 to 3 donuts at a time (being careful to not overcrowd the pot) for 2 minutes. At this point you should be able to see the edges begin to look crisp. Flip the donut and continue cooking until the donuts have expanded and have craggy edges all over, about 1 more minute. Use a slotted metal spatula to transfer them to the prepared cooling rack and repeat with the remaining donuts and donut holes (the donut holes will fry in about half the time).
Once they’re cool enough to the touch (but still warm), dip the top half of each fried donut into the glaze, then place back on the cooling rack (glazed side up) until the glaze has set, about 10 minutes. Serve within 4 hours of frying.
